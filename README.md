# Bootstrap 3 Material Design â€“ Meteor package

This package is basically a wrapper of awesome [FezVrasta's project](http://fezvrasta.github.io/bootstrap-material-design/).

This Bootstrap theme is an easy way to use the new Material Design guidelines by Google in your Bootstrap 3 based application.
Just include the theme right after the Bootstrap CSS and include the javascript at the end of your document, everything will be converted to Material Design (paper) style.

This theme is in early development and is not ready for production.

Check out [the demo at this link](http://fezvrasta.github.io/bootstrap-material-design/).

### Install

Install the package in your Meteor project:

```
meteor add html5cat:bootstrap-material-design
```

~~Batteries~~ Bootstrap 3 included as dependency (mizzao:bootstrap-3).
